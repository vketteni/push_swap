swap next notes

the unsorted node's pointers can be NULL
- when unsorted is HEAD -> unsorted->next is NULL
- when unsorted is TAIL -> unsorted->prev is NULL

[EDGE CASES?]
- node is head OR tail of stack
	-> CAN'T DO (NULL)->next/prev 
- node is adjacent to other node

[REGULAR]
- nodes swap next/prev pointers with each other

(null)<-[Node1]->(p2)(p1)<-[Node2]->(p3)(p2)<-[Node3]->(null)

	Node1	Node2	Node3
pv	null	p1		p2
nx	p2		p3		null

	tmp1 = Node1
	tmp2 = Node2

	Node1->prev = tmp2->prev;
	Node1->next = tmp2->next;

	Node2->prev = tmp1->prev;
	Node2->next = tmp1->next;
